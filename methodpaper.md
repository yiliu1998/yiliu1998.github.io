<b> Advances in Propensity Score Methods </b>

My paper of this section plays around the propensity score, a crucial tool in comparative effectiveness research for balacing covariate distributions and defining goalpost of inference. I have worked on (i) development of new methods when there is lack of positivity; (ii) practical evaluations of novel propensity score weighting methods; (iii) treatment effect estimation using semiparametric efficient and machine learning methods.
