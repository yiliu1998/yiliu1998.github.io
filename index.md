	Welcome to Yi Liu's homepage!

<p>

I am currently a PhD student in the <a href="https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Statistics</a>, North Carolina State University, under the co-advisement of Profs. <a href="https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/syang24/" target="_blank">Shu Yang</a> and <a href="https://bouve.northeastern.edu/directory/larry-han/" target="_blank">Larry Han</a> (<a href="https://bouve.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Bouv√© College of Health Sciences</a>, Northeastern University). My research primarily focuses on developing causal inference and conformal prediction methodologies to analyze various real-world datasets. Previously, I earned my Master of Biostatistics degree from the <a href="https://biostat.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics</a>, Duke University School of Medicine in <a href="https://biostat.duke.edu/news/master-biostatistics-class-2022-celebrate-commencement" target="_blank">2022</a>, under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/roland.matsouaka" target="_blank">Roland Matsouaka</a>. During this time, I developed a keen interest in propensity score weighting methods, which ignited my journey into causal inference with observational studies! More previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from <a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Southeast University</a> in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China in 2020.
