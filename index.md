	Welcome! 
</p>

<p>
	I am currently a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Statistics</a>, North Carolina State University, advised by <a href="https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/syang24/" target="_blank">Prof. Shu Yang</a>, and a member of <a href="https://shuyang.wordpress.ncsu.edu/cima-lab/" target="_blank">CIMA Lab</a>. Previously, I received a Master of Biostatistics from the <a href="https://biostat.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics</a>, Duke University School of Medicine in 2022. During my master's study, I was advised by <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/roland.matsouaka" target="_blank">Prof. Roland Matsouaka</a> and developed interests in methods of propensity score weighting in causal inference and applications of semiparametric efficiency theory. More previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from <a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Southeast University</a> in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China in 2020.
