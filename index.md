	Welcome to Yi Liu's homepage!

<p>

I am currently a PhD student in the <a href="https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Statistics</a>, North Carolina State University. I am co-advised by Profs. <a href="https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/syang24/" target="_blank">Shu Yang</a> and <a href="https://bouve.northeastern.edu/directory/larry-han/" target="_blank">Larry Han</a> (<a href="https://bouve.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Bouv√© College of Health Sciences</a>, Northeastern University). My research focuses on causal inference and conformal prediction methodology for analyzing verious types of data in real world. Previously, I received my Master of Biostatistics degree from the <a href="https://biostat.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics</a>, Duke University School of Medicine in 2022. At that time, I was advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/roland.matsouaka" target="_blank">Roland Matsouaka</a>, and I developed interests in propensity score weighting methods, which started my journey in causal inference with observational studies! More previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from <a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Southeast University</a> in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China in 2020.
