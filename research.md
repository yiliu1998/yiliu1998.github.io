This page will be constructed with more details and beautiful figures in the future once I am done with some interesting projects. My current research lies in the following keywords: causal inference, propensity score weighting methods, observational studies, covariate adjustment and covariate-adaptive randomization in randomized experiments, conformal inference and prediction, federated learning, semiparametric efficient estimation, and asymptotic statistics. Please, do expect more updates :)
