I develop user-friendly software, primarily in the form of R packages, to facilitate the dissemination and application of the methodologies I have proposed. These packages are designed to be accessible and intuitive for users from various backgrounds, enabling broader use of our research in practice.

If you have any suggestions for improvement or encounter any issues while using these packages, I welcome your feedback. Please don't hesitate to contact meâ€”your input is invaluable in helping us enhance the software and better meet the needs of the community.
